# There are a couple of cases where links will appear to be broken:
#
# 1. There is a `View source` link on every page, which will be broken for any
#    files that have not yet been merged into the default branch of the
#    documentation repo.
# 2. If the documentation includes a link to any private repositories, those
#    links will seem to be broken, from the link-checker's POV.
#
# To avoid these problems, we tell the link-checker to ignore any links that
# point to MoJ GitHub entities.
